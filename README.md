# 🔐 Login Password Demo

A simple and playful password login system made in Python. This beginner-friendly project helps you practice user input, conditionals, and functions — and even includes a funny twist if you log in successfully.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries required

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. You’ll be prompted to set a password the first time.

3. Then, you’ll be asked to log in by entering the same password.

4. If successful, you'll be greeted... and maybe surprised 👀.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The program asks if you want to create a new password.
- If yes, it stores the password in a variable.
- It prompts you to log in using that password.
- If you log in successfully, it opens a link in your browser as a joke.
- It uses global variables and basic `time.sleep()` for timing effects.
